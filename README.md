# WrestlingQuizTime
A wrestling Quiz game that i created in C, This was my very first small simple program that i created in C. 

The program begins by asking for your name which is a string that will be stored in memory. Then you will be asked 10 wrestling questions that you have to answer with yes or no. The answers are conditionals, if you answer the the question correctly, the score variable will increment. You must answer all 10 questions correctly to win the game. If you fail to answer all 10 questions correctly you will get a message saying you have failed to answer all the qestuons.
